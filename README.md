# Vector Align

This is a production-ready tool for align parallel documents to sentences without the need for a machine translation system or lexicon.
[Vecalign](https://github.com/thompsonb/vecalign) - an accurate sentence alignment algorithm is used, which is fast even for very long documents.

Instead of [LASER](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER), we use [LaBSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01852) from [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) pre-trained models for its better performance in parallel text mining task.

# Installation (Recommend)
```Bash
pip3 setup.py install 
```


# Example
1. two separate docs
```bash
vector-align \
    --left-doc tests/zh.file \
    --right-doc tests/en.file \
    --output output.txt
```

2. 1 bilingual doc
```bash
vector-align \
    --left-doc tests/bilingual.file \
    --right-doc tests/bilingual.file \
    --output output.txt
```

By breaking down the key issues, we identified the root cause as a lack of abilities of ID hosts and local agencies, which needs systematic improvement. Meanwhile, we can leverage offshore agencies as a key driver to support the continued growth of the local ecosystem.  \n*Based on ID's current development stage, we further discussed that we should focus on high-value viewers to create an efficient growth strategy with limited Ops resources. Specifically includes:\n*On the demand side, we should prioritize high-end device user acquisition: the paying potential of in-app high-end device users has been initially proven; considering TikTok has a relatively low penetration among high-end device users, we can work with UG team to increase the number of high-end device users; \n*Problematic LIVE rooms needs to be identified and addressed: Some of the LIVE rooms where high-value users send the highest amount of gifts are still with problems or controversies. We need to further determine the impact and solutions in order to improve the overall content quality and avoid wasting the traffic of high-end device users on those problematic LIVEs; \n*Increase high-quality content supply by identifying successful host cases and disseminate best practices: To meet the LIVE watch and gifting needs of high-value users, we identified successful host cases by categories and success factors to use them as showcases when providing Ops support; \n*By category:\n*For categories (DJ, tarot, etc.) that already have best practices to follow, we can summarize practice experience and enhance content building through platform-managed hosts or local agencies; \n*For categories (chat, food, etc.) that do not yet have a set path to grow, we can leverage agencies including capable local and offshore agencies to make operation breakthroughs; \n*By business model:\n*For categories with clear business models, it is suggested to focus on improving gifting revenue; \n*For categories with immature business models or relatively low monetization efficiency, we need breakthroughs in both content model and business model. We can consider collaboration with e-commerce and short video teams to build a monetization mix for hosts. \n*专项节奏：11月初我们完成各方对齐及kick-off，并确立了双周汇报、及时迭代的工作节奏，前期进行专项基本信息摸底、识别关键问题，后期针对聚焦课题进行深入分析\n*一、基本信息摸底：我们通过访谈和问卷调查进行业务摸底，初步拆解主播流失的关键假设，形成核心研究课题\n*1.1 公会及主播诉求摸底\n*公会的主要诉求是通过培育头部主播做大流水，但多数公会尚未形成行之有效的方法论\n*公会认为，主播数量决定公会规模，因此常通过跑马圈地的方式大力招新；\n*公会的营收重点来自头部主播，多数公会提及，发展不出头部主播是主要痛点；\n*结合主播访谈结果，当前印尼公会的能力模型较为基础，多数公会在主播招募、主播管理上已初步沉淀方法论，但在短视频内容、直播内容、粉丝挖掘和维护能力方面尚不突出（头部公会与腰尾部公会无明显差别），对主播的赋能有限；\n*公会主播开播的核心诉求是收入提升\n*公会主播开播的核心诉求是收入提升，但多数主播仍将直播定义为稳定性较差的零工经济\n*主播认为，直播无底薪、打赏收入波动大，难以与基本工作相提并论，且对直播行业的前景仍有疑虑\n*当出现任一影响收入因素（预期与实际收入落差大、其他平台政策更优、有其他高收入渠道等）时，主播可能会出现断播和停播；\n*1.2 流失问题定位和关键假设拆解\n*主播流失问题定位\n*按生命周期划分：\n*公会非新手-腰尾部主播流失率，相较其他主播更高，流失率上升更快（+7-8%）\n*新手主播在加入一个月后，流失率超过50%，半数是无效拉新\n*按招募渠道划分：TT印尼公会主播流失，在不同招募渠道（站内招募、站外引入）无显著差异，7-9月流失率均上升（+7-8%）\n* \n*初步拆解主播流失原因\n*新手期主播：主要诉求是获取流量，渡过爬坡冷启阶段。主播流失核心痛点是流量少\n*腰部主播：遭遇涨粉瓶颈、流量低于预期、营收波动且有瓶颈\n*头部主播：常出现于平台封禁导致的主播直播间观众数下降，连带影响收入\n*详见：\n*印尼公会主播流失诊治专项 // ID Churn Streamers Analysis Proj. \n*印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论W1_经营办公室_2021112 \n*印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论W2_经营办公室_20211119 | Special sharing and discussion of the churned streamers of Indonesian agencies W2_Monetization Office_20211119  \n*\nProject timeline: At the beginning of November, we aligned with all stakeholders and kicked off the project, setting a cadence of bi-weekly reports and timely iteration. In the beginning, we gathered all the basic information and identified key issues. Later on, we conducted in-depth analysis of targeted issues. \nI. Basic information gathering: We conducted investigation through interviews and questionnaires, broke down key hypotheses of host churn and came up with key research topics\n1.1 Investigation of agency and host demands\n*The main demand of agencies is to develop top-tier hosts to increase revenue. However, most agencies have not found an effective methodology\n*Agencies believe that their scale depends on the number of hosts they have. Therefore, they make great efforts to recruit new hosts;\n*As a big part of revenue comes from top-tier hosts, most agencies mentioned that the inability to develop top-tier hosts is their major pain point; \n*The host interviews reveal that the current capabilities of ID agencies are still very basic. Though most agencies have found a way to recruit and manage hosts, they are not able to provide enough support to hosts due to limited capabilities in short videos, LIVE content, follower growth and maintenance (no significant difference between top agencies and mid and lower tier agencies);\n*The main demand of agency hosts for going LIVE is to increase revenue\n*The main demand of agency hosts for going LIVE is to increase revenue. However, most hosts still consider livestreaming as an unstable gig.\n*Hosts think that there is no base salary and that the gifting revenue fluctuates greatly, livestreaming can not be compared with regular jobs. Moreover, they still have doubts about the prospect of the livestreaming industry; \n*When a factor impacting revenue appears (big difference between estimated and actual revenue, more favorable policies on other platforms, other high revenue streams), hosts may not go LIVE as often or stop going LIVE completely. \n1.2 Identification of root causes for host churn and breakdown of key hypotheses\n*Identification of root causes for host churn\n*By life cycle: \n*Existing agency hosts - the churn rate of mid and lower tier hosts is higher than that of other hosts and the churn rate also increases faster (+7-8%) \n*More than 50% of new hosts will be gone after one month. Half of those new hosts are invalid new joiners.\n* \n*By recruiting channel: There is no significant difference among different recruiting channels (in-app recruiting, off-app recruiting) with regard to the host churn of ID agencies. The churn rate from July to September was on the rise (+7-8%) \n*\n*Initial breakdown of root causes for host churn\n*New hosts: The main demand is to gain traffic and go through the cold-start phase. The major pain point is limited traffic\n*Middle tier hosts: They experience a bottleneck in growing viewership. The traffic is lower than expected and revenue fluctuates on top of a bottleneck\n*Top-tier hosts: The number of viewers decreases due to bans, which affects revenue\n*See details: \n*印尼公会主播流失诊治专项 // ID Churn Streamers Analysis Proj. \n*印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论W1_经营办公室_2021112(Special sharing and discussion of host churn of ID agencies W1_ Monetization Office_2021112)\n*印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论W2_经营办公室_20211119 | Special sharing and discussion of the churned streamers of Indonesian agencies W2_Monetization Office_20211119  \n*\n*二、方法论提炼：在研究进程中，我们以课题聚焦研究为切入口，总结提炼专项研究方法论\n*2.1 主播流量问题识别：通过数据分析和问卷调研，定位印尼主播流量问题的本质为直播间观看量低\n*关键问题：基于摸底获得的基本认知，我们初步拆解印尼主播流失原因为直播间流量低，在新手期主播、腰尾主播和头部主播群体中均为痛点，需进一步刻画流量问题本质；\n*方法论总结：\n*数据分析：针对公会主播群体，对主播加入公会后30天内的日均ACU数据进行扫描，分层计算主播次月流失率，定位流量问题核心群体；\n*分层逻辑：整体按照ACU数据平均分层，ACU 0-1的主播单独拆解，关注流量极低的情况；\n*问卷调研：面向TT LIVE站内主播全量发送调研问卷，基于问卷反馈，进一步拆解主播流量问题的本质原因；\n*问卷设计：\n*基础信息：包括性别、年龄、招募渠道、是否公会主播等，用于刻画基础画像，并作为后续数据分析的分组依据；\n*开播动机和内容垂类：包括主播开播诉求、主要内容等，重点获取主播的主观动机和自我定位；\n*开播频次和时长：包括主播周开播频次、单次开播时长，及主播对频次和时长调整倾向，理解主播开播表现及变化趋势；\n*开播减少原因挖掘：针对开播频次/时长变化（增加+减少）的主播，进一步追问其主观原因、观看量变化、互动率变化、粉丝量变化；\n*主播痛点挖掘：重点关注主播对公会的痛点、封禁痛点等；\n*问卷投放：\n*投放80k，回收有效问卷1248份；\n*其中公会主播783份（占公会大盘15.5%）、非公会主播465份（占非公会大盘0.3%）；\n*主播调研问卷详见：ID agency affiliated streamer survey_Strategy Team \n*核心结论梳理： \n*（1）印尼主播流量问题的核心痛点是观看量低，其他痛点包括互动减少等\n*扫描主播加入公会后30天的日均ACU流量分层，发现日均ACU 0-5的主播次月流失率更高；\n*问卷反馈，减少开播的主要原因为直播间观看量变低(55%)、其次是互动减少(43%)\n*主播封禁后如果有流量问题，主要集中在观看量减少；\n*（2）印尼主播开播表现呈两极分化趋势\n*公会主播中，高频开播（每周直播\u003e3) \u0026 高时长（单次直播时长\u003e2h)的主播占比44%\n*公会和非公会主播开播表现均呈两极分化趋势，高频开播公会主播，更加勤奋开播；低频开播自营主播，继续减少开播\n*公会主播开播频次变化拐点：周开播≤3次，继续减少开播；\n*预估每周开播≤3次，单次开播≤1小时的主播，如果进一步减少开播，这群人规模可能是：\n*公会主播：11% X 5,051 = 535人\n*非公会主播：34% X 155,982 = 53,336人\n*  \n*详见印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week Update_经营办公室_20211203 | Special sharing and discussion of the churned streamers of Indonesian agencies Bi-Week Update_Monetization Office_20211203 \n*注：主播开播时长及频次的数据来自问卷反馈，可能存在与主播实际开播表现不符的情况，后续需将问卷反馈数据与后台数据进行验真\n*\nII. Methodology summary: In the research process, we used the specific research topics as a basis to summarize the project research methodology. \n*Special thanks to   for her input and constant assistance in dozens of interviews!\n2.1 Host traffic issue identification: We identified the ID host traffic issue as low views by data analysis and questionnaires\n*Key issue: With the basic insights gained from the investigation, we found out that the ID agency host churn is caused by low traffic, which is a pain point across the board for new, mid-tier and top-tier hosts. We need further analysis of the traffic issue. \n*Methodology: \n*Data analysis: We scanned the average daily ACU of the first 30 days after hosts joined an agency. We calculated the churn rate of the following month to identify core groups that experience the traffic issue.\n*Design for tiers: Hosts were evenly distributed into different tiers according to their ACU. ACU 0-1 is a tier by itself as we want to study the cases with extremely low traffic. \n*Questionnaires: Questionnaires were sent out to all TikTok hosts. We further digested root causes of traffic issues based on the responses. \n*Questionnaire design: \n*Basic info:  collecting Info including gender, age, recruiting channel, agency host or not to create basic profiles, and leverage it for grouping for subsequent data analysis; \n*Motivation for going LIVE and content categories: It includes the demands of hosts for going LIVE, main content, etc. The focus is to understand the motivation and self-positioning of hosts; \n*Go-LIVE frequency and duration: It includes the weekly go-LIVE frequency, single LIVE duration, the tendency of hosts to adjust the frequency and duration and the understanding of LIVE performance and change;\n*Identification of reasons for the decreased going LIVE: For hosts who changed their go-LIVE frequency/duration (increase + decrease), we further investigated the subjective reasons, change in LIVE views, interaction rate and viewership growth; \n*Identification of host pain points: We focused on the pain points of hosts experiencing with agencies and bans;\n*Questionnaire survey: \n*Sent out 80k questionnaires and received 1,248 valid responses;\n*783 were from agency hosts (15.5% of agency hosts in total) and 465 were from non-agency hosts (0.3% of the total non-agency hosts) ; \nSee the questionnare: ID agency affiliated streamer survey_Strategy Team \n*Key conclusions: \n*1. The main pain point of ID host is low views. Other pain points include decrease in interaction, etc. \n*After scanning the average daily ACU tiers of the first 30 days after hosts joined an agency, we found out that hosts with ACU 0-5 have a higher churn rate; \n*Questionnaire responses reveal that the main reasons for the decrease in going LIVE are reduced views (55%) and interaction (43%)\n*The traffic issue that hosts will experience after a ban is mainly the reduced views; \n*2. ID hosts show a trend of polarization in their go-LIVE performance\n*Agency hosts who have a high go-LIVE frequency (\u003e3 LIVEs per week) and a long duration (a single LIVE duration \u003e2h) account for 44% \n*The go-LIVE performance of agency and non-agency hosts show a trend of polarization. Agency hosts with a high go-LIVE frequency will go LIVE even more while self-managed hosts with a low go-LIVE frequency will go LIVE even less\n*The turning point of change in go-LIVE frequency for agency hosts: if the go-LIVE rate ≤ 3 times per week, then the go-Live rate will continue to decline; \n*For hosts who go LIVE fewer than 3 times per week and lasting ≤ 1hr per single session, if they continue to go LIVE less frequently, the scale of these hosts could be: \n*Number of agency hosts: 11% X 5,051 = 535\n*Number of non-agency hosts: 34% X 155,982 = 53,336\n  \nSee details:印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week Update_经营办公室_20211203 | Special sharing and discussion of the churned streamers of Indonesian agencies Bi-Week Update_Monetization Office_20211203 \n*Note: The go-LIVE duration and frequency come from the questionnaire responses, which may not be the actual situation. We need to validate them by comparing the questionnaire responses and the backend data. \n*2.2 低流量主播案例排查：通过案例排查，定位主播低流量问题的主要原因及对应解法\n*此处感谢策略运营团队  的分析输入\n*关键问题：观看量低是主播对流量的核心痛点，需进一步对流量低问题进行拆解，探索主播流失问题的优化方向和可行建议；\n*方法论总结：\n*低流量主播案例排查：\n*案例抽取：抽取97个日均ACU为0的case进行逐一排查，包括84个无效主播+13个有效主播（定义有效主播为30天内累计开播时长\u003e1小时的主播）；\n*排查方式：全量排查，从直播时长、直播间推荐状态、粉丝数量和内容质量四个维度定位ACU为0的原因；\n \n*注：共计排查97个case，因部分主播同时命中多个原因，因此case加总后数量超过97；1位主播数据有误，其ACU不为0\n*封禁后流量低主播案例排查：\n*案例抽取：针对问卷中反馈封禁后流量变低的主播，抽取50个样本case进行排查，包括30个公会主播和20个非公会主播；\n*排查方式：从封禁情况、封禁前后ACU变化、主播开播表现三个维度定位问题；受限于数据回溯周期，排查封禁case最近两个月的封禁/断播情况；\n* \n*关键结论：\n*（1）观看量低问题归因\n*印尼公会处于发展初期，本地公会能力不完善，主播缺乏内容和涨粉能力，难以养成良好、长期的直播习惯，当前应通过完善、系统化的教学培训提升印尼公会和主播能力\n*主播直播时长短（场均\u003c10min）、低粉、内容质量差，是导致观看量低的核心原因\n*封禁对观看量影响有限(封禁后ACU下降占比~17%)，开播频次/时长下降、内容质量差是导致封禁主播观看量下降的主要原因\n*（2）观看量问题关键To Do\n \n*详见：印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week _20211217 \n*\n2.2 Analysed host cases with low traffic: through case analysis, identified the primary causes of low traffic and worked out the solutions\n*Special thanks to from the Strategy Ops team for her inputs to the analysis\n*Key issue: the core pain point for ID hosts about traffic is low vv, the causes of which need to be broken down in order to explore possible optimisations and feasible solutions;\n*Methodology:\n*Cases of hosts with low traffic:\n*Case selection: we selected 97 host cases with a daily ACU of 0 and investigated the causes behind each of them. 84 invalid hosts and 13 valid hosts were included (where a valid host refers to someone who went LIVE for more than 1 hour in the past 30 days);\n*Troubleshooting: we scanned all cases and troubleshooted issues in each of the cases in terms of their LIVE duration, recommendation status, number of followers and content quality, so as to find out the reasons behind the 0 ACU.\n \n*Note: though 97 cases were included in the troubleshooting process, the total number of cases added up to more than 97 since some hosts hit more than one of the causes; what's more, due to a data error in one of the cases, of which the ACU should not be 0.\n*Cases where hosts get lower vv after a ban has been lifted:\n*Case selection: we selected 50 cases from the respondents of the questionnaire who mentioned shrunk traffic after a ban, including 30 agency hosts and 20 non-agency hosts;\n*Troubleshooting: we identified the causes from the perspectives of history of bans, changes in ACU before and after the bans, and LIVE performance of the hosts in terms of their LIVE duration and go LIVE frequency. Given the limited period of data tracking, only bans/closes and suspensions in the past 2 months were taken into account;\n* \n*Key conclusions:\n*(1) Attribution of low vv\n*Since agencies in ID are still in their infancy, their capabilities are yet to be improved. Meanwhile, due to the lack of capabilities among ID hosts to produce high quality content and attract more followers, it's difficult for them to develop a good habit of going LIVE on a regular basis. Therefore, at the current stage, we should enhance both agencies' and hosts' capabilities through optimised and systematic training and education.\n*Insufficient LIVE duration (average LIVE duration \u003c 10min), limited fans, and poor content quality are the core reasons behind low vv.\n*Since there is only a small impact of the bans on vv (ACU decreases by around 17% after the bans), decline in go LIVE frequency/duration and poor content quality are the main reasons behind the the downward trend in vv of banned hosts.\n*(2) Key to-dos regarding the low vv issue\n \n*For more details: 印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week _20211217(Bi-weekly discussion on agency host churn in ID_20211217)\n*2.3 印尼发展策略研究：拆解印尼市场现状和宏观条件，初步锁定高价值人群为目标用户\n*关键问题：基于主播流失问题拆解，我们进一步挖掘其反映的本质问题为TT LIVE在印尼的生态未完全成熟，需从消费侧和供给侧共同突破，规划印尼发展策略；\n*方法论总结：\n*印尼发展现状梳理：\n*通过分析印尼冷启以来的业务数据（包括大盘流水、公会流水等），划分TT LIVE的主要发展阶段；\n*梳理印尼过往运营活动的目标、玩法和效果（结合业务数据和运营同学感知），重点识别各运营活动的目标用户；\n*印尼基本信息摸底：\n*通过搜集SEA各国的宏观数据、互联网普及情况、广告市场规模等，基于横向对比，理解印尼市场发展的宏观条件；\n*进一步聚焦TT主端和TT LIVE的业务数据（DAU、营收等），理解印尼TT LIVE发展的关键难点；\n*关键结论：\n*（1）印尼当前处于本地内容生产、内容付费闭环不流畅，仍在探索规模化、还没有完全验证成功阶段；\n*（2）印尼发展宏观条件：\n*印尼贫富差距大，收入两极分化突出；\n*互联网基建弱，智能机人口渗透率在SEA倒数；\n*头部娱乐社交媒体无本地玩家；\n*TT主端MAU渗透率是FB一半，直播开播UV高，看播渗透18%，直播间用户少；\n*（3）印尼增长策略初步判断\n*判断：\n*Value Proposition：TT LIVE应该有自己独特的品牌和价值主张，为印尼本地居民（中产或中产偏下水平）提供得体的创收方式，为金主提供相对高品质的、多元的娱乐方式\n*消费侧，印尼人口众多、财富头部集中，应充分发掘高价值人群的用户价值，理解高价值人群对TT LIVE的内容诉求、打赏动机等；\n*供给侧，印尼暂未形成较好的本地公会生态，已入驻本地公会的能力画像不一定符合TT LIVE需求；\n*打法建议：\n*需求侧切片突破：以印尼高价值人群为核心用户；基于需求理解，TT LIVE可考虑针对性地优化/重塑内容供给，提供适配内容；\n*供给侧资源布局：锤炼内功，发力公会，以公会为抓手教育培训主播；出海公会为本地输出更成熟的公会经营理念和能力，本地公会需重点引入能够识别高潜主播和培训教学主播的公会；\n*详见：印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week _20211217 \n*\n2.3 Strategy for ID: Broke down the the market and macro conditions of ID and targeted high value users \n*Key issue: After breaking down the issue of losing agency hosts, we dived deeper into the problem and identified that the root cause lied in the immature ecosystem of LIVE content in ID. Therefore, we need to develop a strategy that focuses on both the consumption and supply sides.\n*Methodology:\n*Status quo of ID:\n*We separated the development journey of TT LIVE in ID into several stages, according to the performance data of ID since its cold start (including overall revenue, agency revenue, etc.);\n*Identified each of the target user groups on the basis of the objectives, features and results of previous operational campaigns carried out in ID (obtained from performance data and feedback from the local ops team).\n*Basic conditions of ID:\n*Understood the macro market environment of ID by collecting and comparing the data of macro conditions, penetration of the Internet and ad market in each of the SEA countries;\n*Obtained a clear picture of the key pain points during the development of TT LIVE in ID, through a deep dive into the business data of TT's main app and TT LIVE (such as DAU and revenue).\n*Key conclusions:\n*1. At the moment, ID is faced with difficulties in making a closed loop from local content production to gifting. We are still exploring the way of scaling up, but have not proved success completely;\n*2. The macro conditions in ID:\n*There is a wide gap of wealth in ID and a severe problem of income polarisation;\n*The local Internet infrastructure is weak, and the penetration rate of smartphones ranks near the bottom across SEA;\n*Among the list of top entertaining social media in ID there is no local social media player;\n*The penetration rate of TT's main app MAU in high-end device owners in ID is only half of that of FB. In spite of a high go LIVE UV, LIVE watch penetration is only 18% and LIVE watch UV is low;\n*3. Preliminary suggestions on ID growth strategy\n*Rationale:\n*Value proposition: TT LIVE should have a unique brand identity and value proposition of its own, so as to provide a decent way for local users (middle- or lower-class users) to earn revenue and a proper way for top gifters to consume entertaining content that is diverse and of high quality.\n*Viewer side: although there is a large population in ID, its wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few. Therefore, we should make full use of the potential of high-value users, and understand their needs for TT LIVE and motivations for sending gifts;\n*Host side: since a mature ecosystem of local agencies has yet to form in ID, the capabilities of onboarded agencies may not meet TT LIVE's requirements;\n*Suggested solutions:\n*Break through from the consumption side: target high-value users in ID as our core user group; on the basis of their needs, TT LIVE can customise the strategy for optimising/restructuring content supply, so as to provide users with more content they prefer;\n*Make better use of the resources on the supply side: enhance the go LIVE capabilities of hosts through training and educational sessions provided by their agencies; local agencies can also learn about agency operation and host management in a more sophisticated way from offshore agencies; we should onboard more local agencies that a) are able to identify high-potential hosts, and b) provide proper training and education for hosts;\n*For more details: 印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week _20211217(Bi-weekly discussion on agency host churn in ID_20211217)\n*2.4 需求侧突破关键：基于数据分析，明确印尼高价值人群的渗透转化情况，并分析其站内打赏看播行为，找到明确突破点\n*此处感谢策略数据团队  的分析输入\n*关键问题：我们与业务团队对齐高价值人群发展策略后，协同策略数据团队，针对需求侧和供给侧的关键问题进行拆解，需求侧重点明确目标人群规模和潜在营收空间；\n*方法论总结：\n*高价值人群渗透情况分析：以TT LIVE站内高端机用户的付费金额为结果指标，将其拆解为5个因子，通过对每个因子国家间的横向对比，定位印尼DAU高、但高价值用户付费低的问题：\n*因子：国家高端机用户量；TT高端机渗透；高端机看播表现；高端机付费率；高端机ARPPU；\n*站内高价值用户打赏看播行为分析：通过对比印尼大盘、横向对比其他国家，分析印尼站内高端机用户看播、打赏渗透率、ARPPU的表现；\n*关键结论：\n*聚焦TT站内高端机用户，发现站内高端机用户看播打赏表现好于大盘，但TT高端机用户整体渗透偏低\n*站内用户看播打赏表现好于大盘：印尼TT LIVE站内高端机用户看播和打赏行为渗透率均高于印尼大盘，且付费ARPPU是大盘的3+倍，已初步验证了目标群体的营收潜力；\n*TT高端机渗透偏低：印尼人口及高端机人口数量均高于东南亚各国，但高端机人口中仅21%使用TikTok，占比低于其余各国；\n* \n*详见印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week _20220107 | Special sharing and discussion of the churned streamers of Indonesian agencies Bi-Week _20220107 \n*\n2.4 Broke through from the consumption side: Gained a clear picture of the penetration and conversion rate of high-value users in ID through data analysis, and identified the breakthrough points based on their gifting behaviour when watching LIVE on TT.\n*Special thanks to  from the Strategy Ops team for her inputs to the analysis\n*Key issue: After aligning with the Ops teams on the growth strategy for high-value users, we broke down the key issues on both the consumption and supply sides with the Strategy team, and identified the the size of our target users and the revenue potential that they can create;\n*Methodology:\n*Penetration of high-value users: we identified 5 factors that influence our ultimate metric, the total amount of payment made by high-end device users of TT LIVE in ID. Through a comparison of each factor across SEA countries, we found a low paid rate of high-value users in spite of the high DAU:\n*Factors: number of high-end devices owners in a country, penetration of high-end devices among TT users, and LIVE watch performance, paid rate and ARPPU of TT users using high-end devices;\n*Gifting behaviour of high-value users when watching LIVE on TT: After comparing the DAU between ID and other SEA countries, we figured out the LIVE watch performance, penetration of gifting and ARPPU of ID users who use high-end devices to watch LIVE on TT;\n*Key conclusions:\n*TikTok users with high-end devices have a higher LIVE watch penetration and gifting rate than average, but the overall penetration of TikTok high-end device users is relatively low. \n*Higher paid rate: In ID, TikTok users with high-end devices have a higher LIVE watch penetration and gifting penetration and a 3+ times higher ARPPU compared with that of DAU, which has preliminarily verified the spending potential of such users. \n*Relatively low penetration: Both the population and the number of high-end device owners in ID are higher than those in other SEA countries, but only 21% of ID high-end device owners use TikTok, which is lower than other SEA countries. \n \n*More details can be found in印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week _20220107 | Special sharing and discussion of the churned streamers of Indonesian agencies Bi-Week _20220107 \n*\n*2.5 高价值人群内容偏好分析：抽取高价值人群热门打赏直播间，进行打标和内容分析，明确高价值人群的看播及内容偏好\n*此处感谢      支持内容打标与主播访谈\n*关键问题：TT LIVE站内已圈进一批高价值人群（高端机用户），针对该用户热门打赏的直播间进行内容分析，能够明确目标人群的内容偏好，进一步直到站内直播内容供给的迭代；\n*方法论总结\n*直播间打标：\n*样本选择：抽取TT LIVE 11月站内高端机用户打赏的直播间中，营收Top 100的直播间（占高端机人群总付费~12.7%）；\n* \n* \n*内容打标：内容垂类标签是刻画内容能力的维度之一，由于当前TT LIVE暂未对直播内容进行打标，我们以三审标签为基础，结合参考抖音直播内容标签体系，对直播间内容进行手动打标；\n*抖音直播标签：\n*按运营团队划分为6大业务板块、25个垂类\n*高营收垂类：聊天、颜值、唱歌、乐器、舞蹈、多人交友；\n*其他垂类：游戏（抖音游戏撑起了大盘8%的时长，和1%营收）、虚拟主播、二次元、演艺等；\n*注：抖音直播标签体系并不完全适用TT LIVE内容，本文档中打标使用的标签以三审标签为蓝本；\n*直播内容分析：抽取典型案例进行直播间内容回看，并直接访谈典型主播，从主播的基础信息、内容能力、互动能力和金主维护四个维度刻画总结典型主播的核心成功要素；\n*基础信息：主播画像（性别、年龄、职业等）、开播动机、粉丝画像、基础数据（开播时间、粉丝量、收钻数）等；\n*内容能力：直播间基础布置、内容主题等；\n*互动能力：重点关注主播的互动意识和互动方式，如是否强调直播评论等；\n*金主维护：拉取主播金主付费数据，分析主播的付费关系特征（如是否有长期大额打赏的忠实金主等），通过访谈重点关注主播与金主的互动、关系维护方式（如是否有线下见面等）；\n*访谈提纲：Template_印尼主播访谈提纲 // ID Proj.

To better understand such users' preference for content and iterate LIVE content supply accordingly, we analyzed the LIVEs that had received more gifts from such users. \n*Methodology: \n*LIVE labeling:\n*Sampling: We sampled the top 100 LIVEs with the highest revenue among all LIVEs that received gifts from high-end device users in November (gifts received in these 100 LIVEs accounted for ~12.7% of the total gifts sent by high-end device users). \n* \n*Content labeling: Content category labeling is one of the methods for content analysis. But as TT LIVE has not built a LIVE content labeling system, we manually labeled LIVEs based on R3 moderation labels and Douyin's labeling system for LIVE.\n*Douyin LIVE labels:\n*6 business sections with 25 categories by operation teams. \n*High-revenue categories: Chat, good-looking, singing, instrument, dancing, and video/audio chat rooms. \n*Other categories: Gaming (contributing to 8% of Douyin playtime and 1% of revenue), virtual hosts, ACG, performance, etc. \n*Note: The labels in this doc are mainly based on R3 moderation labels as Douyin LIVE's labeling system can not be directly applied to TT LIVE. \n*Analysis of LIVE content: After sampling and replaying typical LIVEs as well as interviewing typical hosts, we summarized the traits of successful hosts from the following four perspectives: host information, content, interactions, and gifter maintenance.\n*Host information: Host profile (age, gender, occupation, etc.), motivation for going LIVE, follower profile, basic metrics (go LIVE duration, follower base, and diamonds received), etc. \n*LIVE content: LIVE room settings, LIVE themes, etc; \n*Interactions during LIVE: Hosts' awareness of interactions and how they interact with viewers, e.g. whether they encourage viewers to comment; \n*Gifter maintenance: We analyzed gifting metrics to better understand gifting behaviors (e.g. whether there're loyal gifters who have been sending high-value gifts to certain hosts for a long time), and interviewed hosts to know more about how they interact with and maintain gifters (e.g. whether hosts have had offline meetups with gifters); \nInterview Outline: Template_印尼主播访谈提纲 // ID Proj. Top hosts Interview Guide \n*Key conclusions\n*1. Content preference of TikTok LIVE users with high-end devices\n*Chat and music are the top 2 categories ranked by revenue (accounting for 44% and 25% of total revenue respectively) among LIVEs that have received more gifts from high-end device users. In contrast, LIVE categories that are usually considered to be popular such as gaming and challenges have not made it to the list; \n*Most gifts have been sent to good-looking female hosts' LIVEs featuring clear audio and high video quality, fixed background, and frequent interactions; \n*We have also noticed that unusual cases account for as high as 17.6% of the revenue generated by the top 100 revenue-making LIVEs, particularly in music \u0026 others categories;\n* \n*Types of unusual cases: low definition (5), short LIVE duration (5), suspected fraudulent activities (5), hosts not showing their faces (4), sexually suggestive (3), controversial content (3), follower-farming or traffic direction (1); \n*Next steps for dealing with unusual cases: to better understand whether the unusual gifting cases have happened because the overall ID LIVE content quality is low, we have aligned with the Strategy Ops team that we would sample LIVEs in ID from the perspective of users to review ID LIVE content quality and see the impact of the unusual cases. Going forward,  's team will work on this as an ad hoc project and report progress. \n*More details can be found inID用户视角大盘画风分析-2020/01-LIVE OPS- WIP (ID LIVE Content Style Analysis from the Perspective of Users - 2020/01 - LIVE OPS - WIP)\n*2. Suggestions for growth: Based on the LIVE content preference of high-end device users, it is suggested that TT LIVE could further iterate LIVE content supply with the following 2 steps. \n*Step 1: Governance (content quality improvement). High-end device users prefer content of higher quality. Therefore, we need to improve the overall content quality of TT LIVE in ID to avoid traffic being directed to low-quality LIVE content.\n*Step 2: Optimization. Identify high-revenue host archetypes and then acquire or cultivate hosts with similar traits accordingly to improve LIVE watch and gifting penetration from the content supply side. \n*More details can be found in 印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week _20220107 \n\n*2.6 典型垂类主播模板总结：通过站内现存垂类挖掘与潜在垂类识别，圈选TT LIVE可重点挖掘的内容垂类，进一步通过典型主播案例总结成功要素\n*关键问题：通过供给侧内容垂类研究，明确高潜垂类和该类主播对应成功特质，为后续针对性主播拉新和垂类生态培育提供可行输入\n*方法论总结\n* \n*注：本次内容分析仅聚焦9月印尼Top1000营收主播，通过人工判断确定内容垂类；缺少竞品标签数据，对竞品内容的判断可能存在遗漏；\n*关键结论\n*（1）现有垂类挖掘\n*现状：聊天、音乐总营收高，其他垂类仍在相对初期发展阶段；\n*高潜：科教、户外、体育垂类人均收钻数高、但主播人数相对较少（主播均\u003c20人），部分已打造showcase，有一定潜力继续提升营收；\n* \n*（2）潜在垂类识别\n*通过扫描Youtube Live、Bigo等竞品平台，我们发现，竞品反馈其内容垂类布局不一，包括聊天、音乐、美食、时尚、户外、跳舞、游戏等；\n  \n*根据UED团队用户访谈得知，整体而言，印尼居民最感兴趣的内容是音乐，其次是美食、生活、新闻资讯、影视等，不同性别、年龄的用户都存在兴趣差异；\n*  \n*注：该用研中对内容一级垂类和二级垂类的划分标准与TT LIVE不完全一致；\n*（3）TT LIVE内容建设策略建议\n*短期：聚焦打赏变现模式已验证、运营难度相对较低的内容垂类，快速打造头部主播，建设用户垂类认知，重点垂类为DJ、塔罗、聊天、探险垂类；\n*中长期：研究讨论是否进一步加强主流垂类建设，打造多元化变现途径，如拓展才艺、健身、美食、户外等垂类；\n* \n*详见印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week _20220121\n*\n2.6 Analysis of hosts in archetype categories: Analyzed existing categories and identified potential ones to pick out the categories that TT LIVE should focus on; further summarized the traits of successful hosts\n*Key issue: Analyze content categories on the supply side to identify high-potential categories and the traits of successful hosts in such categories, so as to provide insights for host acquisition and content category ecosystem development in the future. \n*Methodology\n* \n*Note: a) In this research, we only focused on the top 1000 hosts ranked by revenue in ID in September and manually identified the content categories; b) The labels for competitors' content may be incomplete as we do not have the full list of their content labels\n*Key conclusions\n*1. Analysis of existing categories\n*Status quo: Chat and music are the two categories with the highest revenue; other categories are still at a relatively preliminary stage; \n*Categories with high potential: Science \u0026 education, outdoor, and sports are the three categories with more diamonds received per host, but the number of hosts in these categories is small (\u003c20 each). Some showcases have been built and these categories have the potential to bring in more revenue in the future; \n* \n*2. Identification of potential categories\n*We looked at YouTube Live, Bigo as well as other rival products and found that the content categories vary among different platforms, including chat, music, food, fashion, outdoor, dancing, gaming, etc; \n*  \n*Based on the user interviews carried out by the UED team, ID users are most interested in the music category, followed by food, life, news, movies \u0026 TV, etc., with differences among users of different genders and ages; \n*Note: The definitions of first-tier and second-tier categories in this research are not exactly the same as those of TT LIVE. \n*3. Suggestions for TT LIVE content development\n*In the short term: Focus on categories that have proved their success in monetization through gifting and are relatively easier to operate, and build showcases of top-tier hosts to improve user awareness of such categories. Key ones include DJ, Tarot, chat, and adventure.\n*In the mid-to-long term: Analyze and discuss whether we need to further strengthen mainstream categories (e.g. performance, fitness, food, outdoor, etc.) and explore diverse monetization methods.\n* \n*More details can be found in 印尼公会流失主播专项分享讨论 Bi-Week _20220121(Bi-weekly discussion on agency host churn in ID - 20220121)\n*\n \n*附录\n*主播访谈纪要整理：\n**\n*公会访谈纪要整理\n**\n*内部运营访谈纪要整理\n**\n*Appendix\n*Host interview reports\n**\n*Agency interview reports\n**\n*Internal ops interview reports\n**\n\n
